        "aboutMe": "My fascination with cybersecurity began during my computer science studies when I witnessed firsthand how vulnerable our digital infrastructure can be. What started as curiosity about how systems could be compromised evolved into a deep passion for protecting them.\n\nThroughout my career, I've had the privilege of working with diverse organizations, from startups building their security posture from scratch to enterprises implementing complex security architectures. Each experience has reinforced my belief that cybersecurity is not just about technology\u2014it's about protecting people and their trust.\n\nThe integration of AI and machine learning into my work has opened new possibilities for predictive security and automated threat response. I'm particularly excited about how these technologies can help us stay ahead of evolving threats while reducing the burden on security teams.\n\nBeyond technical work, I'm committed to making cybersecurity more accessible and inclusive. Through mentoring, speaking, and community involvement, I hope to inspire the next generation of security professionals and contribute to a safer digital world for everyone."
